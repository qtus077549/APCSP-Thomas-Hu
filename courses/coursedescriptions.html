                <p>Advst the Cold War Era</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The course studies ways in which the Cold War influenced politics, economics, society, literature, and culture in both the East and
                        West between 1945 and 1991. Beginning with the origins of the conflict, the course takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring
                        the proxy wars, the rapid development of mass media and propaganda, and the Cold War’s impact on literature, art, and music.
                        Major assessments include multimedia presentations on various research topics as well as the writing of an original, scripted piece
                        of propaganda. </li>

                <p>Advst Gothic and Horror Literature</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This course offers students an in-depth exploration of the horror genre. Students will examine the history, characteristics, and
                        motivations of this genre in a challenging, discussion-based setting. The genre’s various evolutions and manifestations across
                        time and culture/country will provide a way to analyze how horror is inextricably linked to social and cultural desires, fears,
                        obsessions, and events. Students will be given the opportunity to analyze and dissect representative literary and cinematic
                        masterpieces from this genre (Frankenstein, “The Fall of the House of Usher,”Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Haunting
                        of Hill House, The Shining, etc.) alongside lesser-known or even unsuccessful examples (mass market paperback fiction, B movies,
                        etc.). Truly horrifying works across genres—literary, visual, theatrical, cinematic, etc.—will be supplemented by a variety of
                        critical and theoretical readings. Students will research and write about a key author/figure in the horror genre, and will analyze
                        central works with an understanding that horror—no matter how supernatural, paranormal, or fantastical—always stems from
                        real-life cultural and social anxieties. Gothic & Horror Literature & Culture will celebrate the ways that artists have channeled
                        national anxieties and global myths into achingly well-crafted stories of terror.</li>

                <p>Advst Modernist Literature</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This course will investigate the work of, as well as the historical and intellectual currents that conspired to create and evolve, the
                        global cultural phenomenon known as “modernism.” This course will consist of close readings across disciplines, from visual
                        arts and music, to theater, dance and film to explore the compulsion for “new” modes of expression during times of propulsive
                        societal change. Beginning with the origins of the Modern Era at the end of the 19th century in Europe, this course will track the
                        challenges to form in artistic and cultural production: from the growth of the avant–garde at the turn of the century, through
                        the countercultural movements of the `60s and `70s and on to more contemporary and postcolonial articulations of modernist
                        expressive potential. Course texts may include work by a varied cast of writers from various literary disciplines and landscapes,
                        such as poets like Charles Baudelaire, Osip Mendalstam, Muriel Rukeyser, T.S. Eliot and Leopold Senghor, novelists like Virginia
                        Woolf, Franz Kafka, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, William Faulkner and Djuna Barnes, playwrights such as Bertolt Brecht
                        and scholars like Darwin, Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Frazier and James. Students will leave this course knowing how to think and
                        write critically about historical, political and theoretical ideas on modernity and progress across time and place. </li>

                <p>Advst Case Studies of South Africa</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From New Zealand’s national rugby team dancing the Hakka, to indigenous leaders in Brazil organizing against the deforestation
                        of the Amazon, indigenous people continue to remind the world that they are powerful, but also vulnerable. In this course,
                        students learn about the ancient histories, cultures, and artistic and literary expressions of indigenous peoples around the world.
                        Following the lead of indigenous voices, in this course students explore what it means to be indigenous. They also investigate the
                        ways that indigenous peoples have affected modern societies, and the way that modern societies have impacted them, in myriad
                        political, social, economic, and cultural ways.  They delve into the challenges native peoples face in maintaining their cultures,
                        and they uncover strategies that indigenous people are developing to imagine a sustainable future for themselves and the world at
                        large. To do this, students analyze literature, film, and historical sources, hone their research, writing, and interview skills, and go
                        on field trips to learn about ways native peoples in Southern California preserve and celebrate their traditions and identities. </li>

                <p>Advst Human Thesis Seminar</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This course offers the most advanced and independent Humanities students the opportunity to identify, hone, and pursue an
                        intellectual passion through research. This course honors Lawrence McMillin’s famous Individual Humanities by continuing
                        McMillin’s teaching and learning ethic, which trusted Webb students to quest for truth, revealed by “great discoveries, great
                        individuals, great virtues.” The course begins with an introduction to research methods and the sharpening of personal interests
                        and individual motivation: What does it mean to wonder, then inquire, and finally earn knowledge? The course gives students time
                        and a structure for sustained, deep research, while steering each student to know the purpose and instructive principles revealed
                        by their individual research, and to have the courage to argue for appropriate action in the contemporary world, in light of their
                        earned understanding. Central to McMillin’s course at Webb was the personal motivation of students. In addition to full approval
                        for Advanced Studies courses, this course expects the highest degree of self direction and students must complete an application
                        (available through the Humanities department) to be in this course. </li>

            <li>
                <p>Advst Existentialism and the Human Condition</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This course examines the rise and influence of existentialism, the literary and philosophical movement that came of age following
                        the Second World War. After a study of the basic principles of existentialism, especially as espoused by the French philosopher
                        Jean Paul-Sartre, we will read representational authors such as Samuel Beckett, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Tom Stoppard,
                        Kurt Vonnegut, Margaret Atwood, Jerzy Kosinski and Banana Yoshimoto. We will study the formation of Feminist Existentialism,
                        and we will trace the influence of existentialism in some very contemporary works such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag.
                        Students should have a foundation in literary analysis, close reading, Harkness-style discussion and expository writing, including
                        the thesis-driven essay. Utilizing these skills students should be prepared to engage in comprehensive and detailed research with
                        an eye toward preparing papers of significant length and weight; these MLA-documented papers will further facilitate students’
                        ability to synthesize materials and to make university-level arguments. More broadly speaking, this course asks students to read
                        and consider deliberately philosophical literary works, to formulate their thoughts on those texts both in written and oral form and
                        to push the boundaries of their own world views, particularly when it comes to questions of meaning and existence. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>AP Statistics is the high-school equivalent of a one semester, introductory college statistics course. In this course, students
                        develop strategies for collecting, organizing, analyzing and drawing conclusions from data. Students learn to design, administer
                        and tabulate results from surveys and experiments. Probability and simulations aid students in constructing models for chance
                        phenomena. Sampling distributions provide the logical structure for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Students use a TINspire graphing calculator, statistical software and Web-based applets and activities to investigate statistical concepts. To develop
                        effective statistical communication skills, students are required to prepare frequent written and oral analyses of real data.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This college-level course gives students an in-depth treatment of limits, derivatives, continuity and integration. Students are
                        expected to move quickly beyond computational proficiency to achieve conceptual understanding. Using a student-centered
                        approach to problem solving, this course relies on the students’ ability to work both collaboratively as well as independently
                        to explore these concepts. Heavy emphasis is placed on connecting algebraic, tabular, graphical and verbal representations of
                        functions. The TI-Nspire graphing calculator is an essential tool for examining properties of various functions, along with
                        on-line resources and computer software such as GeoGebra. This course is a pre-requisite for AP Calculus BC.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This rigorous college-level course builds upon both the conceptual and theoretical foundation students developed in AP Calculus
                        AB. Concepts are often explored using technology, such as the TI-Nspire calculator and GeoGebra software, followed by algebraic
                        proof of conjectures. Emphasis is placed on developing strong communication skills: clearly presenting methods, reasoning,
                        justifications and conclusions using accurate and precise language and notation. Major topics include: parametric and polar
                        functions, vectors, Euler’s method, L’H∑ôpital’s rule, logistic growth, improper integrals and infinite series. Advanced topics
                        studied but not required by the College Board include: epsilon-delta proofs, advanced techniques of integration, work, polar
                        distance and first-order linear differential equations. The course was taught by beloved and honored Webb faculty Jim Dahler, who had taught at Webb since 1987.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Students examine all of the topics in Precalculus, but in greater depth and with an eye toward application to other fields of study.
                        In addition, students are exposed to ideas and topics not ordinarily seen in a Precalculus course, such as fractals, different levels of
                        infinity, graph theory, probability, cryptography and number theory. Considerable emphasis is placed on developing concise and
                        beautiful mathematical arguments. Computer software and the TI-Nspire graphing calculator allow students to fit functions to
                        data and to explore graphical representations of mathematical models. This course provides students with a rigorous preparation
                        for the subsequent study of AP Calculus AB.</li>

                        communication skills and cultural knowledge. This project-driven course combines a general review of Spanish grammar
                        and thematic vocabulary building, which inform student-produced multi-media presentations, including public service
                        announcements, travel advertisements and zany infomercials. Students explore the cultural products, practices, and personalities
                        of Latin America and Spain through a variety of digital and hands-on formats. By the end of this course, students will have gained
                        knowledge of political and social issues relevant to the Spanish-speaking world, while building confidence and fluency interacting,
                        interpreting, and presenting on a variety of familiar topics.</li>

                        our planet. Class activities are in association with the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology and the Lycée International de Los
                        Angeles, a French-speaking elementary school in nearby Pasadena. The goals of the course include giving oral presentations about
                        Webb’s paleontology museum and creating written material in French related to paleontology. This course includes a general
                        review of French grammar, and students engage in group discussions as well as partner and individual activities to actively
                        practice communication. Authentic texts and videos also complement the curriculum. In addition, students read, research and
                        present about contemporary topics using various media, including Internet sites, to describe the many different cultures of the
                        French-speaking world.</li>

                        workings of our natural world. Students are expected to actively pursue this understanding of physical situations by performing
                        mathematical analyses and laboratory explorations. This course has two units and consists of two AP exams: Mechanics (1) and
                        Electricity and Magnetism (2). Mechanics explores kinematics, motion, energy, momentum, rotational dynamics, gravitation
                        and oscillations. Electricity and Magnetism explores electrostatics, capacitors, circuits, magnetic fields and electromagnetism.
                        Successful completion of this course helps prepare students for studies in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering fields at the
                        university level.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This advanced course is designed for those who desire a more in-depth study of general chemistry. The treatment of topics
                        covered in IPC, such as thermodynamics, equilibrium, acid/base chemistry and quantum mechanics is more comprehensive and
                        significantly more quantitative. The course features an extensive, guided-inquiry lab component, in which students are often
                        designing their own procedures. Students utilize the lab to explore challenging questions, such as the effectiveness of different
                        methods for quantifying Vitamin C in a natural product. Problem sets are comparable to those assigned in a first-year college
                        chemistry class, giving students robust problem solving skills. The course culminates with the AP exam in chemistry.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>In this course, students continue to work on vocal technique and interpretation as well as exploring ensemble singing of all styles
                        and periods. In addition to live singing, students learn about studio performance, and have the opportunity to record their work in
                        the Digital Music Studio. Performance is an essential component of this course, so participants are expected to present ensemble
                        and solo work in seasonal concerts, recitals and campus events. This course may be repeated for credit with departmental approval
                        and is open to students with departmental approval after Vocal Training & Techniques, or by audition.</li>
